                <h2>Welcome</h2>

                <p><em>Dear Parents and Guardians, At the Nursery School we strive to provide a great learning environment for each and every child in our care. We recognize that a strong partnership with parents and clarity about expectations for how we will work together in this effort are critical. Please take time to read through this Parent Handbook and to familiarize yourself with its content. It provides important information and helpful guidance. We ask parents to know and follow the procedures and rules contained in this Handbook. We hope it will become your go-to source for information. </em></p>
                <p><em>Nikki Scheele, Director </em></p>

                <p>At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that every child is a unique individual with his or her own pattern and timetable for social, emotional, intellectual and physical growth. </p>

                <p>We believe in learning through play; we provide fun, child-centered activities that effectively engage students. We encourage creativity in all areas with a special focus on the arts to enhance language and thinking. Above all, our goals are that children will develop a genuine pleasure in learning, that they develop confidence in their ability to learn and to accomplish challenging tasks and that they gain experience and skills in interacting with others. </p>

                <h2>Philosophy </h2>

                <p>Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all developmental areas. </p>

                <p>The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. For each class, teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom. In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and Spanish. As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if it would be enriching for our program. </p>

                <h2>Vision Statement </h2>

                <p>Washington University Nursery School:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Values children for their wonder and curiosity, their ideas and creativity, and their delight in play.</li>
                  <li>Values families for their traditions and goals, their commitment to home, work, play, community, and their dreams for their children.</li>
                  <li>Values teachers for their vision, their job in children’s play and achievements, their flexibility and skill, and their commitment and compassion. We support and respect what we learn from each other.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Parent School Partnership </h2>

                <p>When joined by a common set of beliefs and purposes, a school and its parents form a powerful team with far-reaching positive effects on children and the entire school community. As a result, WUNS relies on its parents to understand and embrace the School’s philosophy and values, and fully support its curriculum, teachers/staff, and administration. Working together, parents and school professionals exert a strong influence on children’s development and help them to mature by modeling healthy adult working relationships based on honesty, trust, civility, and mutual respect. The teachers, staff, and administration of WUNS share our parents’ commitment to their children and join them in partnership dedicated to the growth of each child. This partnership begins with timely, honest and open communication between home and school, and is premised on an assumption of goodwill and a shared interest in what is best for each individual child. Parents can best support this climate of trust and respect by communicating concerns openly and constructively to the teacher. If a satisfactory conclusion is not reached, the parent should then contact the Director. Out of respect for the individual needs and privacy of each family, the Nursery School places a high value on confidentiality and expects individual families to honor the same. Efforts to lobby other parents are contrary to the spirit of the Parent School Partnership. By enrolling their child(ren) in WUNS, parents agree to support the School’s vision, follow its rules and policies, and abide by its decisions. Just as parents can expect the Nursery School to share timely information and concerns with families concerning their child, so too the Nursery School expects parents to approach issues and concerns in a spirit of mutual goodwill, using proper channels, and in a manner that gives everyone the benefit of the doubt and leads to collaborative and constructive solutions. While parents may not agree with every decision, in most cases, the parents and Nursery School will find enough common ground to continue a mutually respectful and productive relationship. However, when it is clear that a constructive, positive relationship cannot be maintained, the School reserves the right to deny continued attendance or re-enrollment. </p>

                  <h2>History</h2>  
                  <p>
                        The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                        cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                        Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                        highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                        months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children
                        are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty,
                        staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the
                        community.
                    </p>
                    
                        
                        
                <p>Children come from a variety of countries, cultures and
                        economic
                        backgrounds.&nbsp;The school maintains the high standards of the
                        National Association for the Education of Young Children, by
                        which&nbsp;it&nbsp;is accredited. It is licensed by the State of
                        Missouri.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                        development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                        University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                        assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                        nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’
                        presence enables children to receive additional individual
                        attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                        It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                        children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional
                        all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of
                        indoor gross motor play materials.&nbsp;A large outdoor play area
                        gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                        and play in the sand.
